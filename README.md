# Everydays/Not

Everyday I try to open Houdini and produce something, mainly using VEX. It's a reason to open the software and try new things, hopefully learning a little along the way each day.

I leave the line above as a tribute to my starting something and not finishing! I'll try to keep this more active now, maybe not every day... but as often as I can when time 
permits and creativity strikes.

I upload the source files to these here, and you can see the outputs of them at [carlocarfora.tumblr.com](carlocarfora.tumblr.com)
