# Everydays

Everyday I try to open Houdini and produce something, mainly using VEX. It's a reason to open the software and try new things, hopefully learning a little along the way each day.

I upload the source files to these here, and you can see the outputs of them at [carlocarfora.tumblr.com](carlocarfora.tumblr.com)
